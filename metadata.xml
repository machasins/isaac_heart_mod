Tired of wasting hearts when you pick up more than you needed? Well, this mod aims to solve that problem by spawning whatever you don't use from a heart pickup. 

Only need a half heart but pick up a full heart? We'll spawn that half heart that was wasted, just for you. Half a soul heart away from max health and you stumbled upon a full soul heart? We'll spawn that extra half soul heart just in case you need it. Come across a double heart, but only need a half? This mod will spawn that extra heart and a half, because wasting hearts ain't right.
